# server
for file  server file.ipynb


if line 25 rise error in running server (server file.ipynb file)
like  kernal died  mean large csv can't be converted in xlsx file 



than we have to use different lib (not pandas) to perform concatenation the lib is openpyxl
so i have to use this  for convering small small xls file into a single big file
to writing above logic i have created file with name "server merge xls.ipynb"
